                    <h2>What are causes of weather</h2>
                    <p>On Earth, the common weather phenomena include wind, cloud, rain, snow, 
                        fog and dust storms. Less common events include natural disasters such
                         as tornadoes, hurricanes, typhoons and ice storms. Almost all familiar 
                         weather phenomena occur in the troposphere (the lower part of the 
                         atmosphere). Weather does occur in the stratosphere and can affect 
                         weather lower down in the troposphere, but the exact mechanisms 
                         are poorly understood.</p>

                    <h2>Shaping the planet Earth</h2>
                    <p>Weather is one of the fundamental processes that shape the Earth. 
                        The process of weathering breaks down the rocks and soils into smaller 
                        fragments and then into their constituent substances. During rains 
                        precipitation, the water droplets absorb and dissolve carbon dioxide from 
                        the surrounding air. This causes the rainwater to be slightly acidic, which
                        aids the erosive properties of water. The released sediment and chemicals 
                        are then free to take part in chemical reactions that can affect the 
                        surface further (such as acid rain), and sodium and chloride ions (salt) 
                        deposited in the seas/oceans.</p>

                    <h2>Forecasting</h2>
                    <p>Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology
                        to predict the state of the atmosphere for a future time and a given 
                        location. Human beings have attempted to predict the weather informally 
                        for millennia, and formally since at least the nineteenth century. Weather 
                        forecasts are made by collecting quantitative data about the current state 
                        of the atmosphere and using scientific understanding of atmospheric processes
                        to project how the atmosphere will evolve.</p>

                    <h2>Effect on humans</h2>
                    <p>Weather, seen from an anthropological perspective, is something all humans in
                         the world constantly experience through their senses, at least while being 
                         outside. There are socially and scientifically constructed understandings of 
                         what weather is, what makes it change, the effect it has on humans in 
                         different situations, etc. Therefore, weather is something people often 
                         communicate about.</p>
